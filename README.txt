In EE355_Lab3_3448503090.cpp I wrote a program that takes 
in an input file of pancakes with X,Y,Z dimensions, and 
writes an output file with all the pancakes in the exterior
rows and columns burnt side up, and burnt side down for all the 
interior piles. In lines 25-40 and lines 50-65, I attempted
to rearrange the pancakes by flipping all pancakes from the
desire level to the top. I was unsuccessful in this attempt,
and reverted to flipping the pancakes individually. My hardware 
does not support large arrays up to 512, so I initialized
my arrays to size 100.

I used the following website for fstream functions:
